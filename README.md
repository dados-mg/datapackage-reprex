This repo stores [dataset's examples](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/) for building [Minimal, Reproducible Examples](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)

In this specific case, I want to test [frictionless online continuos validation](https://repository.frictionlessdata.io/)

Is this processo using datapackage.json during validation?
